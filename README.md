# Project Overview
StarkStake Wallet is an AI-powered smart contract wallet that enables users to interact with the Starknet blockchain through simple conversational commands, providing features like natural language transaction signing, balance management, and seamless RPC interactions - all designed to make Web3 more approachable for mainstream users.
# Problem Statement
Current Web3 wallets remain a barrier to mainstream adoption:
Complex technical requirements (addresses, gas, signing)
Intimidating interfaces and blockchain jargon
Multi-step processes for simple actions
High risk of user errors due to complexity
No use on AI for better UX and making smart decisions.
# Results Achieved
* Developed a custom smart contract wallet from scratch, adhering to OpenZeppelinâ€™s wallet standards.
* Implemented the wallet on both web and Chrome extension interfaces, allowing simultaneous maintenance with a single codebase.
* Designed and implemented a secure client-side password system, using an architecture similar to MetaMask.
## AI Features Implemented (Accessible via natural language prompts):
* Transfer tokens from the wallet to any other wallet.
* Retrieve transaction details using a transaction hash.
* Obtain the transaction receipt using a transaction hash.
* Fetch the chain ID of STRK.
* Retrieve the block hash and block number of STRK.
* Get the block number of STRK.
